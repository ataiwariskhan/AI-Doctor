# AI-Doctor
This repository contains a Google Colab notebook (exported as ai_doctor.py) for building an "AI Doctor" â€“ a fine-tuned large language model specialized in medical question answering. The project uses the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-8B base model and fine-tunes it on a subset of the "FreedomIntelligence/medical-o1-reasoning-SFT" dataset .
